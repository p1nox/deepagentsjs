/**
 * Tools that should be excluded from the large result eviction logic.
 *
 * This array contains tools that should NOT have their results evicted to the filesystem
 * when they exceed token limits. Tools are excluded for different reasons:
 *
 * 1. Tools with built-in truncation (ls, glob, grep):
 *    These tools truncate their own output when it becomes too large. When these tools
 *    produce truncated output due to many matches, it typically indicates the query
 *    needs refinement rather than full result preservation. In such cases, the truncated
 *    matches are potentially more like noise and the LLM should be prompted to narrow
 *    its search criteria instead.
 *
 * 2. Tools with problematic truncation behavior (read_file):
 *    read_file is tricky to handle as the failure mode here is single long lines
 *    (e.g., imagine a jsonl file with very long payloads on each line). If we try to
 *    truncate the result of read_file, the agent may then attempt to re-read the
 *    truncated file using read_file again, which won't help.
 *
 * 3. Tools that never exceed limits (edit_file, write_file):
 *    These tools return minimal confirmation messages and are never expected to produce
 *    output large enough to exceed token limits, so checking them would be unnecessary.

// System prompts
const FILESYSTEM_SYSTEM_PROMPT = `## Filesystem Tools \`ls\`, \`read_file\`, \`write_file\`, \`edit_file\`, \`glob\`, \`grep\`

You have access to a filesystem which you can interact with using these tools.
All file paths must start with a /.

- ls: list files in a directory (requires absolute path)
- read_file: read a file from the filesystem
- write_file: write to a file in the filesystem
- edit_file: edit a file in the filesystem
- glob: find files matching a pattern (e.g., "**/*.py")
- grep: search for text within files`;

// Tool descriptions - ported from Python for comprehensive LLM guidance
export const LS_TOOL_DESCRIPTION = `Lists all files in a directory.

This is useful for exploring the filesystem and finding the right file to read or edit.
You should almost ALWAYS use this tool before using the read_file or edit_file tools.`;

export const READ_FILE_TOOL_DESCRIPTION = `Reads a file from the filesystem.

Assume this tool is able to read all files. If the User provides a path to a file assume that path is valid. It is okay to read a file that does not exist; an error will be returned.

Usage:
- By default, it reads up to 100 lines starting from the beginning of the file
- **IMPORTANT for large files and codebase exploration**: Use pagination with offset and limit parameters to avoid context overflow
  - First scan: read_file(path, limit=100) to see file structure
  - Read more sections: read_file(path, offset=100, limit=200) for next 200 lines
  - Only omit limit (read full file) when necessary for editing
- Specify offset and limit: read_file(path, offset=0, limit=100) reads first 100 lines
- Results are returned using cat -n format, with line numbers starting at 1
- Lines longer than 10,000 characters will be split into multiple lines with continuation markers (e.g., 5.1, 5.2, etc.). When you specify a limit, these continuation lines count towards the limit.
- You have the capability to call multiple tools in a single response. It is always better to speculatively read multiple files as a batch that are potentially useful.
- If you read a file that exists but has empty contents you will receive a system reminder warning in place of file contents.
- You should ALWAYS make sure a file has been read before editing it.`;

export const WRITE_FILE_TOOL_DESCRIPTION = `Writes to a new file in the filesystem.

Usage:
- The write_file tool will create a new file.
- Prefer to edit existing files (with the edit_file tool) over creating new ones when possible.`;

export const EDIT_FILE_TOOL_DESCRIPTION = `Performs exact string replacements in files.

Usage:
- You must read the file before editing. This tool will error if you attempt an edit without reading the file first.
- When editing, preserve the exact indentation (tabs/spaces) from the read output. Never include line number prefixes in old_string or new_string.
- ALWAYS prefer editing existing files over creating new ones.
- Only use emojis if the user explicitly requests it.`;

export const GLOB_TOOL_DESCRIPTION = `Find files matching a glob pattern.

Supports standard glob patterns: \`*\` (any characters), \`**\` (any directories), \`?\` (single character).
Returns a list of absolute file paths that match the pattern.

Examples:
- \`**/*.py\` - Find all Python files
- \`*.txt\` - Find all text files in root
- \`/subdir/**/*.md\` - Find all markdown files under /subdir`;

export const GREP_TOOL_DESCRIPTION = `Search for a text pattern across files.

Searches for literal text (not regex) and returns matching files or content based on output_mode.
Special characters like parentheses, brackets, pipes, etc. are treated as literal characters, not regex operators.

Examples:
- Search all files: \`grep(pattern="TODO")\`
- Search Python files only: \`grep(pattern="import", glob="*.py")\`
- Show matching lines: \`grep(pattern="error", output_mode="content")\`
- Search for code with special chars: \`grep(pattern="def __init__(self):")\``;
export const EXECUTE_TOOL_DESCRIPTION = `Executes a shell command in an isolated sandbox environment.

Usage:
Executes a given command in the sandbox environment with proper handling and security measures.
Before executing the command, please follow these steps:

1. Directory Verification:
   - If the command will create new directories or files, first use the ls tool to verify the parent directory exists and is the correct location
   - For example, before running "mkdir foo/bar", first use ls to check that "foo" exists and is the intended parent directory

2. Command Execution:
   - Always quote file paths that contain spaces with double quotes (e.g., cd "path with spaces/file.txt")
   - Examples of proper quoting:
     - cd "/Users/name/My Documents" (correct)
     - cd /Users/name/My Documents (incorrect - will fail)
     - python "/path/with spaces/script.py" (correct)
     - python /path/with spaces/script.py (incorrect - will fail)
   - After ensuring proper quoting, execute the command
   - Capture the output of the command

Usage notes:
  - Commands run in an isolated sandbox environment
  - Returns combined stdout/stderr output with exit code
  - If the output is very large, it may be truncated
  - VERY IMPORTANT: You MUST avoid using search commands like find and grep. Instead use the grep, glob tools to search. You MUST avoid read tools like cat, head, tail, and use read_file to read files.
  - When issuing multiple commands, use the ';' or '&&' operator to separate them. DO NOT use newlines (newlines are ok in quoted strings)
    - Use '&&' when commands depend on each other (e.g., "mkdir dir && cd dir")
    - Use ';' only when you need to run commands sequentially but don't care if earlier commands fail
  - Try to maintain your current working directory throughout the session by using absolute paths and avoiding usage of cd

Examples:
  Good examples:
    - execute(command="pytest /foo/bar/tests")
    - execute(command="python /path/to/script.py")
    - execute(command="npm install && npm test")

  Bad examples (avoid these):
    - execute(command="cd /foo/bar && pytest tests")  # Use absolute path instead
    - execute(command="cat file.txt")  # Use read_file tool instead
    - execute(command="find . -name '*.py'")  # Use glob tool instead
    - execute(command="grep -r 'pattern' .")  # Use grep tool instead

Note: This tool is only available if the backend supports execution (SandboxBackendProtocol).
If execution is not supported, the tool will return an error message.`;

// System prompt for execution capability
export const EXECUTION_SYSTEM_PROMPT = `## Execute Tool \`execute\`

You have access to an \`execute\` tool for running shell commands in a sandboxed environment.
Use this tool to run commands, scripts, tests, builds, and other shell operations.

- execute: run a shell command in the sandbox (returns output and exit code)`;
